  content: "I wrote Keep your streak in the work week on The Human In The Machine today. My article is about how I built ChillBot, a Slack bot that messages me on the weekends to let me know if I’ve contributed on GitHub for seven consecutive days and to encourage me to take a break.\n\nThe message looks something like this:\n\n\n\nHow it works\n\n\n  Fetch all of my activity on GitHub through the Events API. (The API only retrieves up to 300 events, so if you’re a power user, the API may not retrieve enough data to determine if you have a streak or not.)\n  Get every unique date when I did something on Github.\n  Determine how many days I’ve contributed on GitHub by looping through every day starting with yesterday through my decided streak (7 days). And if that day matches a day that I contributed on GitHub then mark it, if it doesn’t then break the loop.\n  If my streak is greater or equal to the number of days I contributed, ping me on Slack.\n\n\nIronically, it took a little bit to break my streak as I was working on this bot on the weekend, but I am proud of any of my gray-square weekends.\n\nYou can check out the code on GitHub and learn how to automate the bot with Amazon Web Services with the steps I wrote up.\n",

  title: "How to get married at an Airbnb",
  category: "notes",
  content: "On Saturday, June 18, Jason and I were married at an Airbnb on the side of a mountain near Manchester, Vermont. It ended up being more beautiful than both of us imagined.\n\nHere’s how we did it:\n\n1. Trim your guest list\n\nWe kept our list to parents and siblings only. Keeping the wedding to immediate family was easier to explain to the people closest to us without hurting feelings. Including us, we were a wedding party rolling nine deep.\n\n2. Book the house of your dreams\n\nAfter hitting dead ends with typical wedding venues, we took to Airbnb. I knew as soon as I clicked the listing that this was it. I showed Jason and he quickly replied: Yes.\n\nHere are some features to look for when choosing your Airbnb venue:\n\n\n  a bedroom for everyone\n  a large dining table\n  space for a ceremony outside (and inside in case of rain)\n  flexible check-in and out times\n  space for the everyone to get ready\n  fun amenities (hot tub, sauna, hiking trails)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Tell your hosts you’re getting married\n\nWe were up front with our hosts about our intentions, and they were supportive all along the way.\n\n\n\n4. Book vendors early and always choose tacos\n\nWe found that traditional wedding caterers had a minimum fee for their services which didn’t scale well with our small wedding. We ended up going with a local restaurant, Gringo Jack’s, who brought us a fantastic taco bar. We found our officiant on Wedding Wire, the photographer from browsing Instagram, and the cake bakery, hair stylists, and florist were also local to the area.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(I custom ordered the bibs on Etsy! The y ended up being really cute and made everyone laugh.)\n\n5. Plan out all meals\n\nSince we were all there for the weekend, each family ended up covering a meal which worked well. I think the hardest part was that we had so many leftovers to divvy up on Sunday.\n\n6. Have a back-up plan\n\nFor a small fee, we paid for wedding insurance just in case our venue fell through. We also searched Airbnb for similar houses in the area just in case. Thankfully we didn’t end up needing any backups.\n\n7. Create a to do list and schedule\n\nWe created a list of everything that needed to happen on Friday and Saturday, including when the vendors would arrive and their names. This allowed us to relax on the day and let our family grab a task when they could.\n\n8. Make a playlist\n\nWe created a rdio Spotify playlist with our ceremony songs first and then the more upbeat lovey dovey songs for the rest of the night. The Airbnb had an amazing sound system throughout the house (even the bathrooms). Jason hit play right before he walked out.\n\n9. Assemble a wedding arch\n\nWe wanted a wedding arch to frame our ceremony space and make it feel more intimate. We also needed something that was easy to break down and assemble. We ended up buying ¾” black pipe from the hardware store and used stakes to keep it sturdy. The florist hung flowers to pull it all together.\n\n\n\n\n\n10. Bring place settings\n\nWe weren’t sure what the Airbnb would have stocked in the kitchen, so we picked up pretty paper and utensil supplies, fancy napkins, and recyclable champagne flutes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOk, I bought a ton of other stuff, too:\n\n\n  Ensidig vases from Ikea\n  Glasig tealight holders from Ikea\n  White candlesticks and tealights from Target\n  Marble tile (that I turned into coasters by sanding them down and adding felt backing)\n  Wood blocks from the craft store that Jason drilled holes to fit candlesticks\n  Copper mugs, pitcher, bar spoon, and jigger\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was a really good day.\n",

Most people use trail cameras for hunting, but my goal is to see what’s running around in my backyard.\n\nArchery\n\nWe learned the parts of the bow and how to shoot. We practiced shooting with a recurve and a compound bow. We shot at a traditional target, a balloon on a target, 3D targets (animal decoys), milk jugs on the ground, and helium balloons.\n\nHitting any target was such a rush. I didn’t expect to enjoy archery as much as I did! And not going to lie, I have a compound bow sitting in my Amazon cart right now.\n\n\n\n\n\nTaxidermy\n\nI was most excited about taking taxidermy since I didn’t get into the class last year. The class lived up to its hype. At the start of class we all got to choose a (frozen) specimen: a chipmunk or a rat. Our instructor guided us through the entire process of taxidermy. It was hard work and required precision and attention to detail. I found it to be very rewarding, even though I had to giggle through some of the gross parts.\n\n\n\n\n\nI’ll take his pins out and remove the tape from his ears in a couple of weeks when he’s done setting (and you know I’ll be posting adorable pics of him at his little desk on Instagram).\n\nTree identification\n\nWe learned how to use tree identification keys by first examining and observing branches. Then we headed into the woods and kept on identifying. I’m looking forward to going through my backyard and taking stock!\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended book: Trees of the Eastern and Central United States and Canada\n\nIt was great to learn new skills this weekend that didn’t involve a screen.\n",

  category: "notes",
  content: "Last year, Ela Conf organizers and I relied on Google Forms for women to submit anything from talks to volunteer applications. Forms worked well for us, but reviewing abstracts in a spreadsheet wasn’t exactly a fun thing to do. With the help of Zapier, I created some efficient little bots that keep us organized and motivated.\n\nVolunteer, proposals, and grant bot\n\nEvery time someone submits a volunteer application or an abstract, a new GitHub issue is created in our private repo and then our organizer Slack channel receives a ping:\n\n\n\n\n\n:raising_hand: Under the hood: First, I created a GitHub account @elaconfbot (so as to not inflate my GitHub graph, make it clear that I’m not creating new issues, and because bots are cute). I made a zap in Zapier that will submit a new GitHub issue by @elaconfbot once a new row in the form’s spreadsheet is added (aka someone fills out the form). We also have a Slack integration that watches the repo for new issues.\n\nWith Zapier, you can also assign labels and even add issues to milestones as someone submits a form. Now instead of reading a spreadsheet, we’ll be able to comment on each abstract and use all of GitHub’s organizational features. I absolutely adore this workflow.\n\nWe have this workflow set up for all of our forms:\n\n\n\nWelcomebot\n\nEvery time a someone requests to join our Slack channel, we get pinged in our organizer channel:\n\n\n\n:wave: Under the hood: Zapier listens for additions to the spreadsheet and sends a message to our Slack channel. We can now add women to our community even faster!\n\n\n\nTicketbot\n\nEvery time someone buys a ticket, we get pinged in our organizer channel:\n\n\n\n:ok_woman: Under the hood: I created a catch hook in Zapier and entered it in nvite’s RSVP webhook setting (thanks for being a sponsor, nvite!) as the trigger. I think this is our favorite bot!\n\n\n\nBots, bots, and more bots\n\nEvery time we get a ping from our :raising_hand: :wave: :ok_woman: bots, we all get excited. Seeing women wanting to participate with and at Ela Conf in real-time is much more magical and meaningful than I think we all anticipated.\n\nIt’s also going to be fun watching @elaconfbot’s contribution graph:\n\n\n\nCan you tell when we opened our call for proposals?\n\nMy next challenge will be building an anonymous feedback system for our speakers. I have a suspicion that it will involve some type of form, GitHub, and then some type of delivery service. I cannot wait to get started!\n\nIf you enjoyed this post, love bots, awesome systems, and advancing women in tech, please consider becoming an Ela Conf sponsor!\n\n",

Wonderful!” — Home\n\nA creepy inbred family1 murders to keep family inbred (to the crooning of Johnny Mathis).

We researched, planned, tweeted, emailed, networked, emoji’d, and stayed up late. Soon the website had ticket sales, a call for proposals, speakers, sponsors, a venue, and at long last, an agenda!\n\nOver the weekend, we had the conference and it was a huge success. Our attendees were excited and eager to learn, and our speakers were fearless and eager to share their stories.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhotos by Nhu Nguyen.\n\nSeveral attendees wrote about their own experiences at ELA Conf, and I really think you should read them:\n\n\n  Where are the women in tech?

To keep it going, we opened our ELA Conf Slack where we have channels for jobs, mentorships, talk proposals, community, and more. A place where we can talk about what’s ahead, but also what’s going on with our lives.\n\nA part of me hopes that we’re actually making it harder for these women to think about leaving tech or even executing on it. After all, your friends are all here at ELA Conf, we’re listening, and we want you to succeed.\n\nELA Conf is one of the things that I’m most proud and honored to have worked on, and I can’t believe that I got to be a part of it just from sending one little email.\n\n:purple_heart: :sparkles: :raising_hand:\n\n",

  category: "code",
  content: "Font Library has delicious data packed into a JSON file. I’ve had an urge to see how else I can hack the file with Jekyll and tonight I was up for the challenge.\n\nTo start, the JSON file is in the root of the Jekyll site, making it a simple file without Jekyll powers. I keep it there so it’s easier to find, especially for contributors. A few times I had considered moving it to _data/ because with a Jekyll data file I can use liquid to loop and if and else the data all I want.\n\nI also thought about duplicating the file so that I’d have the best of both worlds, but that’s hard to maintain. And then I thought about creating a symlink. I had never created one before, but thanks to the Internet I opened Terminal and entered:\n\n$ ln -s ../families.json _data/families.json\n\nAnd :boom: symlink! (Ok, it wasn’t that smooth. It took me a bit to figure out how to write the path. And then after I pushed, I got a build error because I originally didn’t use a relative path.)\n\nBut will it loop?\n\nI created a file in the root families.csv and wrote:\n\n---\n---\n{% for item in site.data.families %}\n{{item.family}}\n{% endfor %}\n\n\nAnd soon I had a CSV file with a list of the font family names.\n\nI also used “very ugly string manipulation hacks” to get a distinct list of tags and in alphabetical order. And with a few more very ugly string manipulation hacks, I got the CSV file looking exactly how I wanted:\n\n\n\n\n\nSince Github pages run in safe mode the file won’t build in production. (It’s still totally a success though.)\n\n",

  content: "This weekend my mom and I had the pleasure of attending the Becoming an Outdoors-Woman workshop at Silver Bay. BOW is an international program that focuses on educating and helping women become self-sufficient through outdoors-related skills. It’s a beautiful program with experienced instructors (who donate their time), enthusiastic volunteers, and amazing women from across the country.\n\nI took:\n\n\n  Basic fishing skills\n  Wild edibles\n  Beginning shotgun\n  Outdoor survival\n\n\nBasic fishing skills\n\nWe learned how the rod works, tying neat and tight knots, setting up a Texas rig, basic fish handling, and how to cast.\n\n\n \n\n\n(I ended up winning a wishing pole at the Friday night raffle :fishing_pole_and_fish: so excited to hit the water next!)\n\nWild edibles\n\nWe discussed foraging etiquette (always take less than ⅓), the best way to become experienced with wild edibles (track a single plant for a year), and we collected some seasonal plants. We made a sumac and raspberry leaf sun tea (really delicious!) and a soup (dandelion leaves, clover, pepper weed, Queens Anne’s lace, carrot, onion, celery).\n\n\n   \n\n\nBeginning shotgun\n\nWe learned proper firearm safety, handling, and shooting. Our instructors went above and beyond by giving us advice to tweak our technique to make sure we hit targets.\n\n\n \n\n\n(I definitely missed more targets than I hit.)\n\nOutdoor survival\n\nWe discussed the importance of being prepared before you hit the trail, we put together a survival pack, and then each of us lit a small fire with a striker and flint (and the cotton ball soaked in petroleum jelly helped).\n\n\n \n\n\nWe cannot wait to go back next year!\n",

  title: "lunr.js and Jekyll",
  category: "code",
  content: "I recently spent some time hooking up a Jekyll site with lunr.js. Lunr.js is a full text client-side search engine and it works rather well. It took me a few tries to understand how lunr works and then translate that into a Jekyll site (I had some help from this post) so here’s a walkthrough of I how got it all connected.\n\nI also built a live demo with my site: http://katydecorah.com/search\n\nTell lunr all about your fields\n\nI started off by creating a file called, lunr-feed.js and adding front matter since I’ll be using logic to loop through my posts.\n\nNext, I declared fields to describe my data (and by data I mean my posts). I can customize the field names, but it’s important to keep the id field (this acts like an unique identifier). I can also add a boost to each field. A boost tells lunr that I want it to favor this field that much more in the context of searching. In my case, I wanted lunr to focus on the content of my posts, so I applied a boost to that field.\n\nvar index = lunr(function () {\n  this.field('title')\n  this.field('content', {boost: 10})\n  this.field('category')\n  this.field('tags')\n  this.ref('id')\n});\n\nNow give lunr your data\n\nNext, I gave lunr my data. This is the data that I want lunr to search and it corresponds with the fields that I defined above. And to keep my data straight, I increment a count to build the id as my unique identifier for each post.\n\n{% assign count = 0 %}\n{% for post in site.posts %}\nindex.add({\n  title: {{post.title | jsonify}},\n  content: {{post.content | strip_html | jsonify}},\n  category: {{post.category | jsonify}},\n  tags: {{post.tags | jsonify}},\n  id: {{count}}\n});\n{% assign count = count | plus: 1 %}\n{% endfor %}\n\nBy adding my fields and data, lunr passes it through its pipeline, processes the data, and builds an object that I’ll query later.\n\nBuild a data reference for lunr\n\nTo complement the data that I gave to lunr, I created an object that contains basic information about each post. This is so I can reference it against lunr’s search results because lunr returns the reference id as a search result and not all the data I gave it.\n\nvar store = [{% for post in site.posts %}{\n  'title': {{post.title | jsonify}},\n  'link': {{ post.url | jsonify }},\n  'image': {{ post.image | jsonify }},\n  'date': {{ post.date | date: '%B %-d, %Y' | jsonify }},\n  'category': {{ post.category | jsonify }},\n  'excerpt': {{ post.content | strip_html | truncatewords: 20 | jsonify }}\n }{% unless forloop.last %},{% endunless %}{% endfor %}\n]\n\nQuery lunr and the match results\n\nFinally, it’s time to query lunr aka query that index object lunr created from my fields and data. Lunr returns id numbers as search results (in order of most relevant) and then I use that id as an index number for my store object so I can output details about each search result.\n\n$(document).ready(function() {\n  $('input#search').on('keyup', function () {\n    var resultdiv = $('#results');\n    // Get query\n    var query = $(this).val();\n    // Search for it\n    var result = index.search(query);\n    // Show results\n    resultdiv.empty();\n    for (var item in result) {\n      var ref = result[item].ref;\n      var searchitem = '&lt;div class=\"result\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"'+store[ref].link+'\" class=\"post-title\"&gt;'+store[ref].title+'&lt;/a&gt; &lt;div class=\"post-date small\"&gt;'+store[ref].category+' &amp;times; '+store[ref].date+'&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;'+store[ref].excerpt+'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;';\n      resultdiv.append(searchitem);\n    }\n  });\n});\n\nNow search\n\nAnd that’s how I brought lunr.js to Jekyll. You can add some fun stuff, like the number of search results or even play around with lunr’s options to really customize the search.\n\n\n  Documentation: lunr.js\n  Demo: http://katydecorah.com/search\n  Code: lunr-feed.js\n  Live file: lunr-feed.js\n\n",

Naturally, we stopped along the way. To get to Siglufjörður we had to go through several tunnels. One of which was a single lane tunnel that had intermittent pull-offs (a real nail-biter).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSiglufjörður\n\nThis small town was known for its herring industry in the mid-century. It’s just an hour outside of Akureyri (Iceland’s second largest city).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn our last day in Siglufjörður, we had lunch at Kaffi Rauðka\n\n\n\n\n\nand visited the museums.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAkureyri\n\nWhile still up north, we did a day trip to Akureyri where we visited the Botanical garden, Goðafoss, and then had sushi pizza at Rub23 (seriously).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd here’s the waterfall of the gods, Goðafoss.\n\n\n\n\n\nto Bláskógabyggð\n\nAfter our time up north, we headed back down Route 1 towards the Golden Circle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBláskógabyggð\n\nFor one night, we stayed in this charming cottage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile in the area we visited Geysir\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nand Gullfoss.\n\n\n\n\n\nto Hvolsvöllur\n\nNext we headed down to Hvolsvöllur. On the way we hit a few sites starting with Vatnsleyfoss.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd then Kerið, a volcanic crater.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen we visited two more waterfalls that were amazing and surprisingly vacant. Here’s Þorsteinslundur.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd our favorite, Gluggafoss.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHvolsvöllur\n\nHvolsvöllur is a small town in a great location for visiting Vík (black sand beaches), more waterfalls, and taking the ferry to Vestmannaeyjar (Westman Islands).\n\nOn our first day in the area, we drove to Vík (about an hour east) and stopped at sites on the way back.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe walked on Reynisfjara beach.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd then the cliffs at Dyrhólaey.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe climbed the steep steps to see eye-to-eye with Skógafoss.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe also spotted these small (uninhabited) houses lodged in these rocks.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd then we ended the day at Seljalandsfoss. This waterfall had it all: a persistent rainbow and a walkway behind the falls.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVestmannaeyjar\n\nOn our second to last full day, we took the ferry to Vestmannaeyjar. We visited museums (pet a real live puffin!) and hiked up Eldfell, an active volcano.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlue Lagoon\n\nOn our last full day we visited the Blue Lagoon, the amusement park of geothermal pools.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor next time\n\n\n  Pack a winter jacket with a hood.\n  Pack an eye mask for sleep. (Surprisingly only one place that we stayed at had black out curtains and the nighttime felt like daytime.)\n  Pack two less shirts.\n  Stay in Reykjavík and take the Flybus upon arrival and the last night.

No, thank you.\n\nJekyll to the rescue\n\nI found a better workflow with Jekyll.\n\nAfter a quick search I found a GeoJSON file with all the countries. I regex’d it into yml format and saved it to my _data folder (in this repo) as countries.yml. That will serve as a reference file; I don’t need to touch it. Actually, Atom will barf if I try to open it, so it stays sealed tight.\n\nNext, I created another file (leave.yml). This is the data that I want to weave in with the country data. For each country, I made sure to use the same exact country name found in countries.yml because later I’ll evaluate the name to match the data up.\n\n- country: United States of America\n  leave: 0\n- country: Mexico\n  leave: 12\n\nI created a Jekyll-ized JS file to output the GeoJSON as a variable. Here’s how I did it:\n\n\n  First, I looped through the countries data.\n  Inside that loop, I looped through my data file.\n  Inside that loop, I told Jekyll that I only want results when the country name matches the country names in my data file.\n  I customized the feature properties based on my data and how they should look.\n\n\nThe code looks like this:\n\nvar countryData = {\n  \"type\": \"FeatureCollection\",\n  \"features\": [{% for s in site.data.countries %}{% for x in site.data.leave %}{% if s.country == x.country %}\n    {\n      \"type\": \"Feature\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"name\": \"{{s.country}}\",\n        \"leave\": {{x.leave}},\n        \"title\": \"{{s.country}}\",\n        \"description\": \"Mothers receive {{x.leave}} weeks paid leave in {{s.country}}\",\n        \"fill\": \"{% if x.leave == 0 %}#fff{% elsif x.leave &lt;= 26 %}#aad8f1{% elsif x.leave &lt;= 52 %}#4bc6df{% elsif x.leave &gt;= 52.1 %}#197caa{% endif %}\"\n      },\n      \"geometry\": {\n        \"type\": \"{{s.type}}\",\n        \"coordinates\": {{s.coordinates}}\n      }\n    },{% endif %}{% endfor %}{% endfor %}\n  ]\n};\n\nAnd here’s what it looks like once Jekyll gobbles it up and spits it out. Now I can load that GeoJSON on a map!\n\nThe workflow ends up being painless. I can make updates to my data file and once Jekyll runs, my map updates. Also, I followed the same process with state data that I got from Mapbox, so I can do some state shape and data matchmaking.\n\nCheck out repo with all the files, data, and fun. And, hey, guess what! I wrote about building a GeoJSON file with Jekyll before — Jekyll and GeoJSON.\n",

  content: "After flipping through past posts, I realized that my lush green static map didn’t match wintery posts. For example, Christmas day hike. It’s winter, nothing is green. Everything is white and then gray and then cold and then sometimes sad. So I needed a map style to match winter (minus the sad).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefault style on the left, winter style on the right. (Read more about my Jekyll-generated Mapbox static maps.)\n\nAt first I created an in-post variable that could swap out my default map ID {% if page.mapid %}, but that would need upkeep. I decided to evaluate the post’s month and assign a map ID based on the season – the post’s month.\n\nFirst, I needed to capture the post’s month. (It seems like I can only grab this value as a string.)\n\n{% capture month %}{{page.date | date: \"%m\"}}{% endcapture %}\n\nNext, I evaluated the month – December, January, February, and March will receive the winter map ID from my config, while other months will receive my default map ID.\n\n{% if month == \"12\" or month == \"01\" or month == \"02\" or month == \"03\" %}{{site.mapid-winter}}{% else %}{{ site.mapid }}{% endif %}\n\nI dropped this statement in my static map call and that was it! All my past winter month posts switched to my winter map ID. A fall map style may come in handy, but I’ll stick with just two for right now. See the full code.\n\nBy the way, for my map styles I’m using Mapbox Outdoors and Winter Wonderland both with small tweaks to remove the labels.\n",

Here’s the original pen:\n\nSee the Pen CSS Units by Katy DeCorah (@katydecorah) on CodePen.\n\nTo store each length name and metadata, I created a multidimensional array in Haml that I looped through. I did this so I could easily change the markup output. I also used AngularJS for the functionality: to update the inputs and to toggle the types.\n\nTo Jekyll\n\nI decided to create a Jekyll gh-pages repo and open up the tool there. I exported the CodePen and created a local Jekyll site. Once I organized the files, I refactored my code to interpolate the AngularJS tags.\n\nAt first I copied and pasted the compiled HTML, but I knew it was going to be a pain to make any markup changes. I ended up reformatting the Haml array to Yaml (via regex find and replace):\n\n- length: em\n  type: font-relative\n  description: This unit represents the calculated font-size of the element. If used on the font-size property itself, it represents the inherited font-size of the element.\n\nI saved the file into the Jekyll _data folder. Using a loop, I ran through each item and rebuilt markup output. My code looks something like this:\n\n{% for item in site.data.lengths %}\n&lt;div class=\"example-container\" data-toggle=\"popover\" data-content=\"{{item.description}}\" title=\"{{ item.length }}, {{item.type}}\"&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"example\" style=\"width: [[ unit ]]{{ item.length }}; height: [[ unit ]]{{ item.length }}\" title=\"[[unit]]{{item.length}}\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n{% endfor %}\n\nTo make content changes, I’ll update the Yaml.

Something to celebrate the fact that I’m done teaching and my free-time is katy-time.\n\nI decided to try a snowflake.\n\nBuilding it out\n\nWith Haml, I spit out 3 div tags to act as the snowflake’s .spindles. I paired the Haml loop with a Sass loop to criss cross the spindles dynamically.\n\n\n\nI created $w to manage the width of each spindle and sized the height at 1em. I always like to have at least one dimension at 1em, because I’ll drop a font-size on that element or its parent to allow the project to scale with respect to 1em.\n\nNext, I used box-shadow on the :before and :after to build the snowflake patterns off the spindles. This took some time to get just right because I had to think in terms of each spindle. Each spindle is part of the pattern pie. Eventually, I got the :before to look like this thanks to box-shadow:\n\n\n\nI added box-shadow to the :after to build the final pattern:\n\n\n\nTo really break it down, a single spindle looks like this:\n\n\n\nNow put your finger at the top of the spindle and turn the bottom at (360/number of spindles) degrees and you’ll get the snowflake pattern.\n\nMaking it scale\n\nI refactored the code to use variables wherever possible with the premise that if I add more spindles then the pattern would purr.\n\nAnd it did!\n\nIf you update the number of spindles in the Haml and Sass, you’ll get a different snowflake. Here is 3 through 26 spindles:\n\n\n\nYou can play with the width of the spindles and patterns, too!\n\nThat was fun.\n",

Either way Jekyll will gobble it up and make something awesome. Jekyll doesn’t discriminate.\n\n.html? Sure.\n\n.md? Yup.\n\n.geojson? Let’s try it.\n\nMaking GeoJSON\n\nA GeoJSON file has a lot of repetition – swap out different coordinates here and maybe a style change there. The pattern lends itself to building a template and adding variables.\n\nAll my adventure posts have coordinates that I use to build a static map header. I decided that I wanted to grab all those coordinates, weave them into a GeoJSON file, and then load it on a single adventure map.\n\nTo start, I worked on my loop and found that this was the best route:\n\n{% assign places = (site.posts | where: \"category\", \"adventures\") %}\n{% for place in places %}\n  &lt;!-- gooey, caramel center --&gt;\n{% endfor %}\n\nI created the file: adventures.geojson and added those six magical hyphens. Next, I wove and massaged until GeoJSON happened:\n\n{\n  \"type\": \"FeatureCollection\",\n  \"features\": [{% assign places = (site.posts | where: \"category\", \"adventures\") %}{% for place in places %}\n    {\n      \"type\": \"Feature\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"title\": \"{{ place.title }}\",\n        \"image\": \"{{ place.image }}\",\n        \"url\": \"{{site.url}}{{place.url}}\",\n      },\n      \"geometry\": {\n        \"type\": \"Point\",\n        \"coordinates\": [{{ place.coordinates }}]\n      }\n    }{% if forloop.rindex &gt; 1 %},{% endif%}{% endfor %}\n  ]\n}\n\nThen, I added a few conditional statements to make sure my data looked tight:\n\n\n  Capture post year. I assigned a marker color based on the year the post was published.\n  Evaluate size of coordinates array. I have at least one post with more than one set of coordinates. The logic is that if a post has one set of coordinates then its a Point or else it’s a MultiPoint.\n  Smart symbol. Based on a post’s tags, I added a symbol to its marker.\n\n\nCheck out the raw Jekyll GeoJSON with all my tweaks and the fresh out-the-oven GeoJSON.\n\nAdventure map\n\nThe map lives here, but hey, I’ll save you a trip:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI built the map with Mapbox.js. I sourced the functionality of my map from Mapbox.js examples. I used:\n\n\n  Load GeoJSON from a URL\n  Custom toolips\n  Fit map to markers\n  Leaflet popup\n\n\nMy map looks tight and now any adventure post will automatically be added to my map.\n\nOn tap\n\nA few things I would like to work on:\n\n\n  Polish colored markers. Right now the markers are colored by year, but that’s not super intuitive. I would like to find a better way to differentiate.\n  Polish MultiPoint. This could be styled slightly different to bear a relationship with all the points in the feature.\n  Style a map for my site. Right now I’ve been using a map that I styled with Editor, but I should really get my hands dirty with Studio.\n\n\nCan you tell that I work for Mapbox now? &lt;3\n",

In this case, I used &amp;course_name. Next, I dropped *course_name where I want &amp;course_name to be repeated.\n\nYou set the variable with &amp;keyword and recall it using *keyword.\n\n\n  Repeated nodes (objects) are first identified by an anchor (marked with the ampersand - “&amp;”), and are then aliased (referenced with an asterisk - “*”) thereafter.\n— Yaml Spec\n\n\nYou can repeat multiple nodes:\n\ncoursename: &amp;course_name Intermediate Interactive Design\nsemester: &amp;this_semester Fall 2014\ndescription:\n - *course_name\n - Informatics Department\n - University at Albany\n - *this_semester\n\nNow I can use either variable as I normally would and the repeated node will slide in smooth. Oh so smooth.\n\nYou might notice that I moved the description to an array.

I started with one the preset styles. I changed the terrain color to the background color of my site. Next, I adjusted the alpha of the streets, buildings, areas, and water to about 50%. This lightened up the map without me needing to do so in CSS.\n\nSome of the maps have a very cool effect, such as the map I used for this post (as see in my Palmertown Mountain Range post). I’m really digging it.\n\nI updated the front matter on all my map-having posts with coordinates. Now this entire site runs on the static Mapbox API.

After several minutes of tinkering, I whipped up Twinner Spinner.\n\nMeet the elements\n\nThe main element, .loader, acts as a container for the spinner. The real magic happens in its pseudo elements. I did this because once you animate a main element it can be tricky to control its pseudo elements. I also used the main element to dictate the size of the project since I’m using ems.\n\nPseudo what\n\nI styled the :before and :after similarly; each element is a 1em circle with a transparent border. However, one element received left and border-left-color values, while the other received right and border-right-color values.\n\nMy use of the border properties may seem redundant, but the elements need a border all around to keep the border from pinching in.\n\nAnimation\n\nOnce I got the elements styled and in place, I created a animation to rotate the elements. I found that by adding an animation-delay to one of the elements, I could give the spinner a little more personality, especially paired with an ease animation-timing-function.\n\nVariable-ing Up\n\nEven though I had everything looking pretty darn sweet, I put variables in where I could. By doing so, I can now control the speed, size, and colors of the spinner from the top of my Sass.\n\nNaturally, I created a few spin-off spinners.\n\n\n\nSee the Pen Twinner Spinner II by Katy DeCorah (@katydecorah) on CodePen.\n\n\nSee the Pen Slicer Spinner by Katy DeCorah (@katydecorah) on CodePen.\n\n\nSee the Pen Twisty Spin by Katy DeCorah (@katydecorah) on CodePen.\n\n\n\nI absolutely love a scalable project with smart variables.

The bright colors and striking shadow drew me in. I decided to code it out with a Sass function.\n\nGetting started\n\nI started by grabbing the code from my first ever Sass function, DotMama. I striped it down and adjusted the values to output for text-shadow. The new function, shadow(), generates many, cascading shadow rules and gives the appearance of one chunky shadow.\n\n@include text-shadow(shadow(#ff5c31,0,0.1em));\n\nThe function accepts the color of the shadow, the position that the shadow should start, and the width of the shadow.\n\nSpinning with @while\n\nI started by using a @for loop to spin out the shadow values, but it limited my desired output. I wanted the shadow to stop at specific point allowing for customized shadow thickness. With a little digging, I found that @while is much more suitable for this situation. I altered my function to stop adding shadow values once the x value of the shadow equals the value of the shadow width.\n\nStart shadow\n\nI can also tell the function where I want the shadow to start. This value provides an interesting degree of depth, but I have it set to 0.\n\nBelow is a demonstration of the shadow start in use.\n\n\n\n(Please laugh in a Spanish accent in cadence with the animation above before continuing with this post.)\n\nPixels vs ems\n\nI started out by using relative units because a 1px increment will result in the smoothest shadow. I wanted the project to scale proportionately based on font-size, so I shifted the values to allow for ems.\n\nBelow, I blew up the project to demonstrate the difference between the two units. The left is built in pixels and the right in ems.\n\n\n\nWhile the ems are less smooth, it will generate significantly less code than pixels.\n\n\n\nUsing ems looks a little less romantic because the function values must be teeny decimals, but slimer, scalable code is ace.\n",

I love these playlists.\n\nJail breaking the playlists\n\nWhen I got a new computer in 2012, I didn’t save my playlists in iTunes properly. In short, my files got disconnected from my library.

Now I had a table containing all my playlists with track title, artist, and album.\n\nNext, I migrated the database to PHPmyadmin. Using PHP I spun out each playlist into markup and pasted the contents into its own post on this site. It worked great, a little time consuming, but it worked.\n\nImporting to Rdio\n\nAfter some more hacking, I was able to import the playlists into Rdio using re/spin. Re/spin easily imports any Last.fm or Spotify playlist into Rdio. The service also accept XSPF. I was able to save each playlist as an XSPF and import it into Rdio.\n\nNot all songs transferred over, but enough did to make it worth it. Re/spin will want to find something if Rdio doesn’t have a match, so beware of some funky replacements. Otherwise, re/spin is a fabulous service.\n\nDatarrhea\n\nAt this point I had my playlist data stored in an SQL table, in Rdio, and in individual posts. I started to feel guilty about shoveling my data in every direction.\n\nI decided to tighten up the process.\n\nJekyll data files\n\nI ditched the database and moved the playlists into a single YAML file. Using PHP, I outputted the playlist data into YAML format. I had to clean out special characters, but in all it worked beautifully. I saved my data into playlists.yml in my site’s _data folder.\n\n\n\nUsing liquid, I could now spin through the data. To test, I created a playlist master page that pulls all the data from playlists.yml into a beautiful list.\n\nThings were looking tighter, but I still had duplicated data on my site. I had the playlists stored in the YAML file and I had the markup I copied and pasted into individual posts.\n\nI put Jekyll to work.\n\n\n  I ripped out the content from all the playlist posts.\n  I matched the names of the posts to the names of the playlists.\n  To my post layout, I added the condition that if the page.category == 'playlists' then include single-playlist.html\n  The single-playlist.html will then loop through playists.yml where the post title equals a playlist name. If the playlist name matches, it will output the data for that playlist only.\n  Since I replaced the content for these posts, I updated my feed to link directly to the Rdio playlist and have no content.\n\n\nNow I can adjust the markup of my playlist posts just by changing single-playlist.html. Likewise, I can control all the playlist data by editing playlists.yml.\n\nAdding new data\n\nMy new workflow for adding a playlist to my site at the end of the season:\n\n\n  Open up the Rdio playlist to be exported.\n  Run the bookmarklet to output the playlist in YAML format (more about this below).\n  Copy and paste the YAML at the bottom of playlists.yml\n  Create a new post title with the same name as the playlist.\n  Serve Jekyll/commit and the playlist data will automatically populate into the new post.\n\n\nRdio bookmarklet\n\nI found this great bookmarklet that scrapes the title, artist, and album from a given Rdio playlist. I’ve had little experience with bookmarklets, but I hacked away at it. My version outputs the playlist into YAML. It also grabs the playlist title, image, and link to the playlist on Rdio.\n\nAt this time, I need to make sure that the entire playlist is loaded and that I open the “Share” modal, otherwise the bookmarklet won’t find those values. I’ll make the bookmarklet sweet on a rainy day, but for now it works despite the conditions.\n\n\n\nRdio playlist to YAML bookmarklet\n\nIt felt great to get my playlists under one roof. It felt even better to figure out how to use data files in Jekyll.\n",

  content: "See the Pen Dots by Katy DeCorah (@katydecorah) on CodePen.\n\nThe other day I came across the Dribbble shot Cross by Helvetic Brands. I loved the pixels and the animation, so I started to code it out. I used a single element to create the first pixel and then used box-shadow to generate the rest. I started to add the animation, but I spun myself in another direction.\n\nI cloned the box-shadow, creating two sets of dots and had the pair square dancing, as seen above.\n\n1 dot + box-shadow = 16 dots\n\nWith the single element, .dot, I used its pseudo elements to house each set of dots. The actual element serves as container. The width and height of the element adjusts to the $size of the dots, the number of $dots, and the number of dot $rows.\n\nEach pseudo element creates the first initial dot, the upper-most, left-most dot. The dot sets the precedent for the box-shadow dots using $size.\n\nI used box-shadow to spin out 4 rows and 4 columns of dots. I admit that I first wrote out the shadow values by hand (more on that later). Instead of assigning the color value of the box-shadow, I used the color property within each pseudo element to control the color.\n\nNegative Delays\n\nI created an animation cross that translates the pseudo elements around a rigid square (down, right, up, left). At first I calculated the translate values by hand. Then I figured out how to replace the values with a variable using $size to make the animation scalable.\n\nanimation: cross 2s infinite ease-in;\n\nI created a second animation criss to apply to the second pseudo element. Then I remembered that I had seen that you can use a negative value on the animation-delay to give the animation a head start. I nixed the criss animation, duplicated the original rule, and added a negative delay.\n\nanimation: cross 2s infinite ease-in -1s;\n\nSquare dancing dots!\n\ndotMama: The Sass Function\n\nI had the project finished, but I wanted to optimize my code.\n\nI sent myself on a mission to write a Sass function to output the box-shadow values. I had never written a Sass function before, but I found a post about creating Sassy Text Shadows by Adam Stacoviak. I borrowed the bones of the function and started hacking at it.\n\nEven though my function needed to loop through a small set of value, I started to confuse myself. I kept getting in my head about it. Maybe it was the complex function I was altering or the fact that I was playing with a new syntax. Whatever the reason, I decided to switch languages for a hot minute.\n\nI thought to my myself, “How would I write this at work?” I am limited to ColdFusion at work. Yeah, it’s not sexy, but its the language that I’m currently pounding away at daily, thus it’s freshest in my mind.\n\nWithin a couple minutes, I wrote the following loop in ColdFusion using absolute values:\n\n&lt;cfset x = 0&gt;\n&lt;cfset y = 0&gt;\n&lt;cfset max = 16&gt;\n&lt;cfset row = 4&gt;\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;cfloop from=\"1\" to=\"#max#\" index=\"i\"&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;#x#em #y#em 0&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;cfset y = y + 3&gt;\n&lt;cfif i % row eq 0&gt;\n&lt;cfset x = x + 3&gt;\n&lt;cfset y = 0&gt;\n&lt;/cfif&gt;\n&lt;/cfloop&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\nNext, I translated the ColdFusion to Sass and added in my relative values.\n\n@function dotMama($max,$r,$x,$y) {\n  $output: '';\n  @for $i from 1 through $max {\n    $output: $output + '#{$x} #{$y} 0';\n     @if $i &lt; $max {\n       $output: $output + ', ';\n     }\n    $y: $y + ($size * 2);\n    @if $i % $r == 0 {\n      $y: 0;\n      $x: $x + ($size * 2);\n    }\n  }\n  @return unquote($output);\n}\n\nI am the proud creator of the Sass function, dotMama.\n\n(p.s. holy hell, I used modulus!)\n\nPlay, please\n\nI tried my darndest to make this whole project scalable. Try changing the $dots and $rows in the Sass. You will find that the dots do a great job of following your orders.\n\n\nSee the Pen Dots by Katy DeCorah (@katydecorah) on CodePen.\n\n\nSee the Pen Dots by Katy DeCorah (@katydecorah) on CodePen.\n\n\n",

Each .item is supposed to resemble the letter ‘L’. (In my first commit I totally wrote that it was the number ‘7’, re: title.) To get the shape, I assigned the top and right border-color colors, while I gave the bottom and left border-color transparent values.\n\n\nSee the Pen Leadership Letters demo 1 by Katy DeCorah (@katydecorah) on CodePen.\nCreating the shape with border\n\n\nAt first, I didn’t use the bottom or left borders at all. Instead, I used box-shadow to cast a white lip around the broadside of each element providing space between each .item. By doing that I had to increment the z-index to keep each element’s noise underneath the previous. Unfortunately, the first element in the z-index stack was then on top of the last element. I scratched my head for a while, until I removed the box-shadow and clipped each element’s nose with a transparent left border.\n\nTwo cheers for simple code.\n\nCircling\n\nNext, I needed to get each .item on a circle and rotated about 45 degrees to achieve the cascading effect. I tweaked the items on a circle mixin until each element fell into place. I’ve used the mixin before, but I must not have examined the code. I didn’t realize that you can assign more than one rotate values in one transform rule. (I learned something new today /air guitar/).\n\ntransform: rotate(0deg) translate(0.875em) rotate(45deg);\n\nUsing the two rotates, I balanced out the items onto the circle and then locked them into position.\n\n:nth-of-what\n\nI used :nth-of-type to alternate the colors of my Sass list, $colors. I thought I had the :nth selector game figured out, but it took me a few tries to alternate the colors among the items.\n\n:nth-of-type(4n + 2)\n:nth-of-type(4n + 3)\n:nth-of-type(4n + 4)\n\nThe above will then compute as:\n\n\n  4 (0) + 2 = 2, 4 (1) + 2 = 6\n  4 (0) + 3 = 3, 4 (1) + 3 = 7\n  4 (0) + 4 = 4, 4 (1) + 4 = 8\n\n\n(I think that this makes sense to me. Hi, I’m insecure about :nth.)\n\nThe first and fifth elements take the initial style from .item.\n\nBorder animation\n\nOnce I had the project built out, I started playing around with a few of the properties. I found that by increasing the border-bottom-width each element would appear to tuck its tail in, which created a beautiful inner circle. I added an animation to bounce from sharp edges to smooth edges to capture all the shapes.\n",

My qualifications include: loving the taste of ice cream.\n\nI’ve started to develop a favorite ice cream recipe that I adapted from Key Lime Ice Cream. In my limited experience, I’ve found that some recipes will produce an icy tasting ice cream, but this recipe keeps it smooth and creamy.\n\nThe mixins section contains examples of different flavors that I’ve tried. I recommend researching other recipes to learn how to integrate other flavorful ingredients.\n\nThe recipe yields two pints.\n\nIngredients\n\n\n  2 large eggs\n  4 egg yolks\n  1 ¼ cups white sugar\n  2 ¼ cups heavy cream\n\n\nMixins\n\nFor key lime:\n\n\n  1 T lemon zest\n  ¾ cup lime juice\n\n\nFor coffee:\n\n\n  2 T instant coffee grounds\n\n\nDirections\n\n\n  Whisk together the eggs, egg yolks, sugar, and mixins in a saucepan over medium heat until well-blended.\n  Continuously stir the egg mixture with a wooden spoon until thickened, 7 to 8 minutes. The mixture should be thick enough to coat the back of the spoon. (If you have a thermometer the mixture should reach about 170°F.)\n  Remove the mixture from heat and stir in the heavy cream until smooth.\n  Strain the mixture through a fine sieve set over a clean bowl.\n  Cover and chill the mixture in the refrigerator, stirring occasionally until cool, about 1 hour.\n  Pour the chilled mixture into an ice cream maker and freeze according to manufacturer’s directions, 10 to 15 minutes. The consistency should be like a milkshake.\n  Transfer ice cream to a lidded container and cover the surface with plastic wrap and seal.\n  Freeze for at least 2 hours or overnight.\n\n\nRecommendations\n\nI use these pint containers. The containers are great, especially for giving ice cream as gifts.\n\nI store the pint containers in a freezer bag, I find that it helps keep the ice cream from getting freezer burnt.\n\nFor extracting egg yolks, I will crack the egg into a clean hand over the sink. I will coddle the yolk, but allow the egg whites to slip through my fingers.\n\nWhen making coffee ice cream, you might want to consider decaf if you intend on eating ice cream before bed.

I used a variable here so that the gradient stays in proportion.\n\nI coupled the @keyframes with animation: charge 0.5s infinite linear; on :before. Once the background-position gets to (($size /2) - $border) it runs again, but it’s seamless so we can’t tell.\n\nIt took me a few tries to get the repeating-linear-gradient just right. Gradients are so useful, but dang… I need to spend more time with them.

  title: "Mapbox for Jekyll posts",
  category: "code",
  content: "As of 7/26/2014, this site has moved to the Mapbox static API.\n\nA few months ago, I began playing around with the Google Static Maps API. I integrated it with my Static Google Maps Image for Jekyll Posts and created a Static Map Maker.\n\nSince then, the Google maps have worked great with my posts. All I need to do is add locations to my front-matter and Jekyll logic handles the rest. It was sometimes annoying having to fiddle with the zoom to make all of the map markers fit on the map, but other than that Google maps worked.\n\nI started playing with the Mapbox API this weekend. The API has so many features that I started a wish list for my posts with maps:\n\n\n  full width map\n  automatically fit markers to map\n  customize the overall look and feel\n\n\nI decided to roll Mapbox into my site, much like I did with Google maps.\n\nStarting out\n\nAfter skimming through the Mapbox.js examples, I knew that I wanted to focus on the Fit Map to Markers example. In this example, the markers are saved as GeoJSON and then that data is loaded into the marker layer. However, I want to define my locations in the front-matter of my Jekyll post, not create a GeoJSON file. To make this happen, I needed to find a way to define my locations in the flesh.\n\nI clicked around the examples, until I found what I was looking for in Load GeoJSON example. This example uses the variable geojson to hold all of the map marker data.\n\nMy next step was to marry the two examples:\n\nvar map = L.mapbox.map('map', 'katydecorah.h41bj3lj'),\n   geoJson = [\n      {\n        \"type\":\"FeatureCollection\",\n        \"features\":[\n          {\n            \"type\":\"Feature\",\n            \"properties\":{\n              \"title\":\"DC\",\n              \"marker-color\":\"#2A2B26\"\n            },\n            \"geometry\":{\n              \"type\":\"Point\",\n              \"coordinates\":[\n                -77.03887939453125,\n                38.89530825492018\n              ]\n            }\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    ],\n   markerLayer = L.mapbox.markerLayer().setGeoJSON(geoJson).addTo(map);\nmap.fitBounds(markerLayer.getBounds());\n\nIt worked!\n\n\nSee the Pen Mapbox -- Testing by Katy DeCorah (@katydecorah) on CodePen.\nDemonstration with multiple locations.\n\n\nJekyll and Mapbox\nNow that I had the map working, I was confident that I could integrate Mapbox into my Jekyll posts.\n\nIn the front-matter of this post, I added locations, just like I have done in previous posts to generate a Google map (I’m using coordinates until I have time to crack geocoding). I added a new flag to this post, mapType: Mapbox, which will let Jekyll know that I want to use Mapbox and not Google maps.\n\nThe following is currently in this page’s front-matter to generate the map:\n\nmapType: Mapbox\nlocations:\n - \"-73.7629483,42.6539068\"\n - \"-73.7254484,43.2440284\"\n - \"-82.5525523,35.5908429\"\n\nSince I’m still exploring and learning the Mapbox API, I’m not 100% ready to break up with Google maps on my posts. For now I will allow Google maps on previous posts, but I will use the flag to let Jekyll know when to use Mapbox.\n\nI altered my Google map code to consider the new Mapbox flag:\n\n{% if page.locations %}\n&lt;div{% if page.mapType %} id=\"map\"{% endif %} class=\"post-map-header\"&gt;\n\t{% if page.mapType %}{% else %}\n\t&lt;img src=\"http://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/staticmap?{% for location in page.locations %}{% if forloop.first %}center={{location | replace:' ','+' }}&amp;amp;markers=color:blue%7C{{location | replace:' ','+' }}{% else %}&amp;amp;markers=color:blue%7C{{location | replace:' ','+' }}{% endif %}{% endfor %}&amp;amp;zoom={% if page.zoom %}{{page.zoom}}{% else %}13{% endif %}&amp;amp;size=1280x180&amp;amp;scale=2&amp;amp;sensor=false&amp;amp;visual_refresh=true\" class=\"post-location-image\" alt=\"untitled\"&gt;\n\t{% endif %}\n&lt;/div&gt;\n{% endif %}\n\nIf the post has mapType, then Jekyll will add id=\"map\" and it will not load the Google map. For this page, which has mapeType, the logic above will output:\n\n&lt;div id=\"map\" class=\"post-map-header\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\nIn my end.html include, that wraps up every post and page, I added a new include, mapbox.html. This include contains the following logic:\n\n{% if page.mapType %}\n&lt;link href='//api.tiles.mapbox.com/mapbox.js/v1.6.1/mapbox.css' rel='stylesheet' /&gt;\n&lt;script src='//api.tiles.mapbox.com/mapbox.js/v1.6.1/mapbox.js'&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n&lt;script&gt;\nvar geoJson = [{\"type\":\"FeatureCollection\",\"features\":[{% for location in page.locations %}{\"type\":\"Feature\",\"properties\":{\"marker-color\":\"#2A2B26\"},\"geometry\":{\"type\":\"Point\",\"coordinates\":[{{location}}]}}{% if forloop.last == false %},{% endif %}{% endfor %}]}],\nmap = L.mapbox.map('map', 'katydecorah.h41bj3lj',{zoomControl: false}),\nmarkerLayer = L.mapbox.markerLayer().setGeoJSON(geoJson).addTo(map);\nmap.fitBounds(markerLayer.getBounds());\nmap.dragging.disable();\nmap.touchZoom.disable();\nmap.doubleClickZoom.disable();\nmap.scrollWheelZoom.disable();\nif (map.tap) map.tap.disable();\n&lt;/script&gt;\n{% endif %}\n\nIf the page has mapType, then it will load Mapbox and create the geoJson variable. The geoJson variable is constructed using a loop on the current page locations.\n\nFinalizing\n\nI decided to disable dragging and zooming because for posts, the map is more supplemental and for context. I didn’t want my visitors to get lost in a scroll. I also overrode the cursor: move  on .leaflet-container,.leaflet-clickable to default to not confuse visitors since the dragging and zooming is disabled.\n\nI added opacity to .leaflet-tile-pane to allow the map to slightly recede.\n\nI added an animation to the .leaflet-marker-icon to allow the map markers to glide onto the map. I love how the tiles transition in and I wanted to see if I could push it a little further.\n\nI didn’t do too much to customize the look and feel of the map, but I definitely plan on growing into it.\n\nGeocoding\n\nIt wasn’t until after I finished all of this, that I found the Initially Position Map with Geocode example. I had assumed that I would need to collect the coordinates for the locations, instead of using a string. I studied the example and played around with it for a while. I was able to set the bounds of a map based on an array, but I just didn’t have the time to figure out adding map markers. I will have to return to this later, because string locations are much easier to work with when creating posts on the fly. Plus, it would give me the opportunity to roll Mapbox into my past posts.\n\nConclusions\n\nI realize this might not be a typical use case for Mapbox, considering that I pretty much neutered the map into a static map. Nevertheless, I love automating features and it was still cool to figure out. I’m excited to develop this feature more into my posts.\n\nMapbox produces gorgeous maps and has great documentation to help you show them off.\n",

  content: "See the Pen Escape by Carla Corrales by Katy DeCorah (@katydecorah) on CodePen.\n\nI have another single element project! I explored the Dribbble shot Escape by Carla Corrales.\n\n.marker\nThe main element, .marker, is the map marker shape. The :before is the inner circles and the :after is the dial.\n\n\n\nI created the marker shape by using a border-radius: 100% 100% 0;. Then I rotated the element 45 degrees, making it sit on its point. I used a linear gradient for the two-toned look of the background.\n\n\nSee the Pen Escape -- Observe 1 by Katy DeCorah (@katydecorah) on CodePen.\nDemonstration of map marker style.\n\n\n:before\n\nI used the :before element for the inner background. I created the inner rings by using two gradients, linear and radial. Initially I used inset box-shadow to create the rings, but I lost a section of the two-toned background. Layering the radial gradient on top of the linear gradient worked better in this case and gave me a reason to tinker with gradients.\n\nBelow is a demonstration of the linear and radial gradients coming together.\n\n\nSee the Pen Escape -- :before -- demonstration by Katy DeCorah (@katydecorah) on CodePen.\nDemonstration of linear and radial gradients.\n\n\n:after\nI used the :after element for the dial. First, I created a rectangle using border. I used border because the dial is four-toned and I can set each border side to a different color. Next, I skewed and rotated the element. I skewed it until I squashed the height and elongated the width.\n\nThe results were… dial-shaped!\n\n\nSee the Pen Escape -- :after -- demonstration by Katy DeCorah (@katydecorah) on CodePen.\nDemonstration of :after style.\n\n\nThis baby is scalable. Open it up in CodePen and change the $size (easter egg: try a number less than 5em).\n\nOne last thing, did you give it a hover yet? Scroll back up there and do it. Yes, I am bossing you.\n\nUpdated 01/18/2014\n\nI wanted to give this Pen a little more pizazz by making the dial spin immediately and then spin again on hover. To make this happen, I needed to trade in my transition for animation, but more importantly, I needed to learn more about animation-play-state. I had never thought to use this property until I read Lea Verou’s, Smooth state animations with animation-play-state.\n\nStarting out, I added the animation to .marker:after and I added animation-play-state to .marker:hover:after. I wanted the animation to play and then play again on :hover. After trying out all of the values and combinations of values, I finally began to understand this property. I like to think about animation-play-state like watching a movie and the remote is my :hover target.\n\n animation-play-state: running;\n\nFor my first try, I used the value running. Nothing happened. The animation was already running and then on :hover, I asked it to run again.\n\nIf I’m watching a movie and press play then my action won’t be productive.\n\n animation-play-state: paused;\n\nNext, I tried the alternate value, paused. It kind of worked. The animation didn’t play when I was hovering, but it played once I hovered off of the target.\n\nIf I’m watching a movie and I press pause, the movie will pause. I’m guessing that the animation restarted because it triggered the original animation on .marker:after to run again. (I need to look into this.)\n\n  animation-play-state: paused, running;\n\nA little confused with my previous tries, I checked out MDN. I read that both values can be used, which led me to try paused, running. This value worked great! The dial spun on :hover.\n\nI was watching a movie, I paused it and then played it again.\n\nThis example might be a little stilted; I definitely plan on exploring animation-play-state more!\n",

Soon my sister started watching and then it became a show my boyfriend and I watched together. We all loved Cheers and being able to share it with our parents.\n\nWhen my sister was home for summer, my parents were finishing their wills and they asked if we wanted any particular possessions. To break the somber tone, I requested mom’s Cheers sweatshirt.\n\nMom bought the sweatshirt at a rest stop on a trip home from Boston in the early 90s. It is dark blue, has a small bleach stain, is incredibly soft, and it was currently in my sister’s possession. She wasn’t planning on giving it up. We spent the following months playfully bickering over the sweatshirt.\n\nOn Christmas Eve, my sister handed me a box. The tag read, “Consider this a truce.” I opened the box and there it was — the Cheers sweatshirt. As I stared at it, I realized that I didn’t want to take it from her. I told her that she shouldn’t have given it to me, but she said she didn’t. She found this one on eBay.\n\nI had a nice laugh, but we were all laughing when we found out that mom also got all of us Cheers sweatshirts.\n\nIt was 2013 and I received two Cheers sweatshirts for Christmas.\n",

  content: "See the Pen Flat icon by _Bosco by Katy DeCorah (@katydecorah) on CodePen\n\nI recreated the Dribbble shot Flat icon by Bosco.\n\nEach award is a single element (.award) that uses additional classes to decide the color (.gold, .silver, or .bronze) and the type (.badge or .ribbon). These additional classes allow for mix and matching of the colors and award types. The award is scalable based on font-size. Try changing the $fontSize in the Sass to see the scaling powers. Please note that the awards are so adorable when the value is small.\n\nWhile $fontSize controls the size of the number and ultimately adjusts the size of the element (all ems all errrthang), $size dictates the actual size of the award around the number. Try adjusting $size in the Sass to change the proportion of the award to the number.\n\nThe awards are all styled the same, but .ribbon and .badge provide different styles for the pseudo elements. I dreamt up the ribbon tails for .ribbon quickly. I manipulated the border by styling a transparent border-bottom-color, which created two triangles for the ribbon tails. I added height to the element to elongate it into a ribbon. I created one tail out of each pseudo element.\n\n\n\nI started to sweat a little while creating the badge. I didn’t think I had enough pseudo elements to achieve what looks like a hexagon. In the end, I managed to skimp on a side. I created a rectangle out of the :before and used a horizontal gradient to create the three stripes. Then I created a triangle out of the :after, but kept it solid colored. Luckily the medallion fit nice and snug up where the triangle and rectangle met.\n\n\n\nCan you tell that I got an iPad for Christmas?\n",

It worked, but it didn’t match up perfectly.\n\n\n\n\nAnd then, it came to me… a trapezoid!\n\n\n\n\nThe trapezoid fit perfectly. I also used a variable $ribbonSize to keep the ribbon tails in proportion with the shadow. In doing so, the ribbon became scalable!\n\nPreserve the stacking order on transform\n\nPrior to this project, I noticed issues in preserving the stacking order, z-index, of elements once a transform is introduced. Until now, I didn’t know how to remedy it, so I avoided it.\n\nOnce I added transform to the main element, the pseudo elements appeared to disregard the z-index: -1 rule and sat on top of the main element.\n\n\n\nThrough research, I dove into the situation of what takes place between stacking orders and transforms. I learned that once transformed, an element needs to play by 3D rules. Without specifying the transform-style, I was technically still in flat mode.\n\n\n  If flattened, the children will not exist on their own in the 3D-space.\n– transform-style by MDN\n\n\nTo allow the children to exist on their own, I needed to pepper in a couple more properties. First, I told my main element to preserve-3d.\n\n.ribbon {\n\t...\n\ttransform-style: preserve-3d;\n}\n\nNext, I controlled the stacking order of the pseudo elements through translateZ. Think of translateZ as the 3D version of z-index.\n\n.ribbon {\n\t...\n\ttransform-style: preserve-3d;\n}\n.ribbon:before, .ribbon:after {\n\t...\n\ttransform: translateZ(-1em);\n}\n\nAfter adding these properties, my ribbon tails popped back into place behind the ribbon.\n\nBelow is a playground I created to test translateZ.\n\nSee the Pen z-index &amp; transform by Katy DeCorah (@katydecorah) on CodePen\n",

  content: "See the Pen Heroes Queue by Antonas Deduchovas by Katy DeCorah (@katydecorah) on CodePen\n\nI love trying to find different ways to get a job done. Especially when it means using a certain piece of technology in an unexpected way. Maybe the job is silly, but it’s the problem solving that I really, truly dig.\n\nAt first glance, I knew I wanted to somehow play around with the Dribbble shot Heroes Queue by Antonas Deduchovas and I was definitely thinking single element for each character, but with tons of box-shadow. However, I also knew that I didn’t want to do the grunt work. So I opened up a spreadsheet in Google Drive.\n\nGoogle spreadsheets to the rescue\nIn a new spreadsheet, I resized the rows and columns to 25 and turned word text off. Now I had a grid, unscathed by lengthy text. I opened the shot in Photoshop and added a grid to closely match each bit of the image.\n\nFormat &gt; Conditional formatting\nBefore this project, I had known about a cool feature in Google Spreadsheets, conditional formatting. You can set conditions in the spreadsheet to style a cell based on a string or digit. If there is a match then the background color or font color of that cell will change according to your rule.\n\n\n\nVariables as conditions\nI set up my color variables as conditional formatting. For example, in any cell that had $bg, the condition called for that cell to be the background color I selected. I added more rules for other variables such as $red, $face, and $shirt. This step isn’t necessary, but it improves the experience.\n\nWriting out the characters\nWith one eye in Photoshop and another in Google Drive, I started typing my variables into the spreadsheet. As I entered a variable that matched a condition, the background instantly changed. It only took a few minutes to assign a color variable to each cell. Plus, spreadsheets allow for mass select and paste, it was a snap.\n\nI ended up creating each character on  a 26×26 grid or in spreadsheet terms A1:Z26. This grid size came in handy later when concocting the formula.\n\n\n\nYou might notice that I didn’t need to include $bg. I could have left those cells blank, because in the end I’m just going to ignore those cells because the body background can make up for it. I’m a visual person, so  putting those values in worked for me.\n\narrayFormula()\nOnce I had the character ready, it was time for formula magic to output my box-shadow values.\n\n=ArrayFormula(if(A1:Z26&lt;&gt;\"$bg\",\"(\"&amp;column(A1:Z1) -1 &amp;\" * $width) (\" &amp; ROW(A1:Z26) -1  &amp;\" * $width) 0 0 \"&amp;A1:Z26&amp;\",\",\"\"))\n\n\n\nI entered this formula in the first cell after the last column, AA:1. This formula went through A1:Z26 and transposed all of the cell data, but I carefully defined the output so that each cell declares its own box-shadow value.\n\nThe formula does the following:\n\n  If any cell within A1:Z26 doesn’t equal “$bg”, then reformat the cell, but if it does then do “” (create a blank cell — so yes, the variable is superfluous as previously stated).\n  To reformat the cell, as seen in the second set of double quotes, each permitted cell generates the following box-shadow values &lt;offset-x&gt; &lt;offset-y&gt; &lt;blur-radius&gt; &lt;color&gt;,. Each cell dynamically adjusts the offset-x and offset-y values of the shadow according to its position in the spreadsheet. I set the blur-radius to 0 and used the existing cell data for the color of the shadow.\n\n\nInitially, I had used static values, for example: 9em 0em 0 $red,, but that meant I couldn’t scale the character because this was based on 1em. Instead, I made the values relative: (9 * $width) (0 * $width) 0 $red,. Now whenever I adjust the $width the character will stay in perfect proportion.\n\nGimme all the box-shadows\nOnce I entered the formula into cell AA:1, the character was automatically transposed into box-shadow values. From there I selected all AA1:AZ26 cells, copied, and pasted as the value of box-shadow: into my CSS. And done!\n\nFeel free to check out the spreadsheet that I used to create these characters.\n\n(I highlighted AA1 to indicate that that cell holds the formula.)\n\n\n\nWhen I pasted the code it had some undesirable spaces and returns, but I quickly regex replaced that sucker into a dreamy column.\n\n\n\nPhat code\nThis code is heavy. So heavy. I know it’s irresponsible for every day wear, but it’s fun and this is one of my favorite ways to learn new things. I spend my work days creating web-based trainings that must be pristine in IE7. For that reason, I crave projects that push boundaries.\n\np.s.\nI tried to get the same animation in the Dribbble shot with the characters bouncing up and down. Unfortunately, the animation didn’t take too kindly to all the values. It rendered a trippy, slapping of box-shadows, that was sure to melt a computer into liquid, Alex Mack style. I settled with a hover, so did you hover?\n",

  content: "See the Pen Simple Box by Katy DeCorah (@katydecorah) on CodePen\n\nThe .box is a single element. I used the transform property and pseudo elements to achieve the result.\n\nThe main element is the top of the box. Initially, I made the main element the left side of the box. I think that was knee-jerk reaction for wanting to move left to right. However, styling this box is much easier when the main element is the top. The top will serve as an important reference point for the remaining sides of the box.\n\nI started by drawing out a square and then rotating it 45 degrees and skewing it -15 degrees.\n\nI added an animation in the example below to demonstrate the transform values used in creating the box top.\n\nSee the Pen Simple Box, 1 by Katy DeCorah (@katydecorah) on CodePen\n\nI used pseudo elements, :before and :after, to create the left and right sides of the box. Since it’s a box, I styled the sides with the same dimensions as the top, using the variable $boxSize.\n\nI was curious where :before and :after would lay before I started transforming them individually. Without telling the transform otherwise, :before and :after assumed the same transform values (in this case, skew and rotate) from the main element. Without applying each pseudo element’s own skew and rotate, I ended up creating a stack of elements.\n\nI added an animation in the example below to demonstrate the stack of elements before I transformed them into sides.\n\nSee the Pen Simple Box, 2 by Katy DeCorah (@katydecorah) on CodePen\n\nTo create the sides, I skewed each pseudo element 45 degrees and then translated it into place. I translated each side relative to the size of the box, making the box scalable. If you adjust $boxSize, the box will happily scale to your input. I also applied a slight adjustment of 0.025 to the translate. I found that the sides didn’t match up exactly how I liked them, so I persuaded them into place.\n\nI added an animation in the example below to demonstrate the transform (skew and translate) used to create the sides of the box.\n\nSee the Pen Simple Box, 3 by Katy DeCorah (@katydecorah) on CodePen\n\nI also tweaked the background for each element to take $mainColor, adjust the hue, and lighten it slightly to add dimension to the box.\n\nAnd there you have it, a box.\n\nHooray!

(The animation will only run a couple of times here, but on CodePen it’s infinite… hypnotizing even.)\n\nI used only two elements for this project by putting box-shadow to work.\n\nThe main element .rabbit is the rabbit’s body. The :before is the tail, but then I used box-shadow to resize, recolor, and relocate the element’s shadow into making the rabbit’s eye. I added another box-shadow and made the rabbit’s hind leg. Then I added multiple shadows to create the front leg.\n\nSimilarly, the rabbit’s :after is one ear. By using box-shadow, I was able to create the second ear.\n\nI created one cloud using pseudo elements, but then used box-shadow to display two more clouds.\n\nSpread-radius\n\nThe fourth value of box-shadow controls the size of the shadow, or spread-radius. Until today, I had severely under used this value.\n\nbox-shadow: &lt;offset-x&gt; &lt;offset-y&gt; &lt;blur-radius&gt; &lt;spread-radius&gt; &lt;color&gt;\n\nMore on box-shadow\n\nThe spread-radius is optional, but the value is 0 unless specified. If the spread-radius is greater than 0, then the shadow will grow. If the spread-radius is less than 0, then the shadow will shrink. When shrinking the shadow, you have to use small units (especially in ems), otherwise the shadow will disappear.\n\nSo in the case of .clouds:\n\n.clouds {\n\t...\n\tbox-shadow: 5em 2em 0 -0.3em white, -2em 2em 0 white;\n}\n\nThe first box-shadow creates a copy of the element, but is moved to the right 5em and down 2em. I slightly shrunk the new cloud, using -0.3em for the spread-radius. Naturally, I set the color of the cloud to white. For the second box-shadow, I moved it to the left 2em and down 2em, but kept it the same size. I set the blur-radius to 0 for both shadows so that there is no blur and I receive a crisp cloud.\n\nGetting the @keyframes just right took a bit of adjusting, but I loved how this rabbit came to life!\n",

  category: "code",
  content: "See the Pen Random Customizable Balloons by Katy DeCorah (@katydecorah) on CodePen\n\nI saw this Dribbble shot and decided to spin out a few ideas. I ended up creating customizable, random-generated, scalable balloons!\n\nI started by creating a single .balloon element. I styled the main element for the actual balloon shape, the :before for where the balloon is tied, and :after for the string.\n\nAfter I styled the first balloon, I absolutely positioned the balloon from the bottom, using the height of the string as the bottom value. I set the html and body height and width to 100% and hid the overflow, to keep my balloon on the page and at the bottom.\n\nTime for more balloons!\n\nI added more .balloon elements and wrote a Sass loop to give each balloon slight customizations. For example, I adjusted the hue of each balloon based on a predetermined color. I also used rgba to give a nice transparent look to the balloons whenever they collide.\n\nbackground: rgba(adjust-hue($balloonColorStart,random(360)),0.5);\n\nHere $balloonColorStart is defined at the top of my Sass file, to be easily changed.\n\nIn the Sass loop for the balloons, I created a variable called $stringHeight and set it to a random number up to 20em. I used $stringHeight for the height of the :after (which represents the string) and for the bottom value for each balloon element in the loop. Just like I had done before with my first balloon, but now dynamic.\n\nI also created a variable, $balloonLeft, to increment itself after every iteration of the loop to be applied as the left value. This made sure the balloons remained evenly spaced out.\n\nAt this point, I thought I was finished, but when I changed the width and height of the balloons to make them smaller, I noticed that the they didn’t scale so well. The pseudo elements were no longer centered at the bottom of the balloon and the balloons were awkwardly spaced.\n\nLet’s make this thing scalable.\n\nI decided that the balloon width, or $balloonWidth, would be the main variable in keeping my proportions tight. From this variable, I calculated the height of the balloons by hitting height: $balloonWidth * 1.25. Now the height and width of my balloons are in proporation.\n\nNext, I adjusted my :before, or the rubber tie part of the balloon, to be in proportion with the width of the balloon. Here’s what I came up with:\n\nwidth: $balloonWidth / 8;\nheight: $balloonWidth / 14;\nbottom: ($balloonWidth / 14) * -0.75;\nleft: ($balloonWidth / 2) - ($balloonWidth / 14);\n\nI went back and forth between setting the $balloonWidth from a low number and then to a high number and decided that those equations suited my rubber tie part of the balloon best.\n\nFor the balloon string, I did a similar guess and check. I only needed to control the left position of the :after element, to center the string on the balloon, and found  left:($balloonWidth / 2.1); to be the sweet spot.\n\nI also adjusted the $balloonLeft variable to take into account the balloon width. By doing so I added a new variable, $balloonProx to tweak the proximity of the balloons: $balloonLeft: $balloonLeft + ($balloonWidth/$balloonProx);\n\nLastly, I added a slightly floaty animation. I used random for the animation time, for a more natural, whimsical feel. I’m all about the whimsies.\n",

When I tried to move the files manually, SourceTree thought I deleted the files and then created new files elsewhere. When I commit files like this, SourceTree is usually smart enough to catch on, but it wasn’t happening. No good.\n\nIt took me a while to figure this all out, so I figured I’d share.\n\nIn the root, I had nearly 1000 files with the following naming schema: L1T1-page01.cfm (standing for lesson 1, topic 1, page 1). All together there are 8 lessons, each lesson has multiple topics, and each topic has multiple pages.\n\nI needed to move these files from the root and into organized folders: L1T1-page01.cfm would reside at lessons/01-lesson-name/01-topic-name/L1T1-page01.cfm.\n\nSo I had to git mv these files myself; a new-to-me command.\n\nFirst, I moved batches of files belonging to the same topic to their respective topic folders by hitting this command:\n\ngit mv L1T1* lessons/01*/01*\n\n(Can I get a hell yeah for that asterisk?)\n\nAfter I moved the files I realized I wanted to shorten the filenames from L1T1-page01.cfm to 01.cfm.\n\nWithin each topic folder, I hit the following command:\n\nfor f in *.cfm; do git mv $f $(echo $f | sed ‘s/L[0-9]T[0-9]-page//g’);done\n\nUpdate 1/7/2014: I revisited this post, I’m so glad I had save these commands!

I loved his graceful transitions between each mouse, which made the experience more of a metamorphosis.\n\nWhen creating a metamorphosis, I recommend building the result or hover state first.\n\nIn this case, I started with the zombie face. Once I had the zombie face, I copied all of the styles and pasted them under the hover state for the .head element. At this point, when I hovered on the head I saw no difference, because it was a zombie face hovering to zombie face.\n\nNext, I needed to make the normal state the normal face. To do this, I carefully adjusted the styles of the normal state. I tried to be consistant among elements with styling to make smoother transitions. If there was an element that appeared in one state, but was removed from the next, I tried to use opacity instead of display:none. I’ve found that opacity will usually give you a more pleasant transition.\n\nLastly, I * styled a transition to allow all of the elements to glide into zombie mode when hovered. I also tried to remove redundant code from the normal and hover states where possible.\n\n(My code could be cleaner, but I didn’t feel like being picky on a fun Pen.)\n",

I’ve only dabbled in Angular, but it came in handy because it’s so great with forms.\n\nHead Scratcher\n\nOne thing that had me scratching my head: how to evaluate an expression, but then output something else. For instance, when there is no value for the API Key input, I don’t want the parameter to be displayed in the API call. Because if the value of api is blank, it can throw an error. I knew I needed a way to check the value of the input and output code based on that evaluation, but I couldn’t  figure out how to write it.\n\nFinally, I figured it out.\n\n{{ e.API !== '' &amp;&amp; '&amp;key='+e.API || ''}}\n\nWherever this is present, it will evaluate the input and then output based on evaluation. If the input does not equal an empty string, or if the input has a value, (e.API !== '') then output &amp;key=[whatever the api key is] otherwise (||) show '' (empty string).\n\nI evaluated the checkbox for the Map Marker (showMarker) the same way:\n\n{{ showMarker == 'true' &amp;&amp; '&amp;markers=size:'+e.markerSize+'%7Ccolor:'+e.markerColor+'%7C'+e.location.split(' ').join('+') || '' }}\n\nAngular is pretty cool.\n",

Each list item has an anchor tag, naturally, but I made sure that the majority of the physical design was styled in the anchor tags. The actual list items handle more of the function.\n\nFor instance, each li element on hover will release the dropdown. This made sure that as I hovered into the dropdown, it didn’t slide back up. Had I put event on the anchor tags, once I hover off of the parent and onto the children, the dropdown would slide back up.\n\nLikewise, I styled the anchor tags to make sure the styles didn’t intrude on the effect when the dropdown was activated. Had I styled the background of the li elements, when hovered the dropdown would be hugged by the color of the list-item’s parent.\n\nThe overall effect of the accordion is achieved by skewing the list items, but I also made the overflow hidden when the dropdown is inactive.

I wanted to write the animation/keyframes in the external stylesheet, but that wasn’t going to work. The animation kept reseting to 0. For example, if it’s 1:15, the minute hand would initially start at 15 (rotate 90 degrees) and then rotate slowly to the next minute (96 degrees). Instead the animation would only start 0 degrees; I couldn’t get the inline rotation to speak with my external animation. To make the animation work, I wrote internal Sass so that the first keyframe was at the starting time and not reverting to 0.\n\nFeatures\n\nI spent some extra time figuring out how to support different timezones. The clock is currently set at UTC-4 (EST). You can easily change the timezone in the Haml, it’s the very first variable.\n\nThe CSS is all em-based and happily responsive. When the width/height is too small, then the digital time displays.\n\nFor an added bonus: the background color darkens as the day progresses. (My better half suggested that one.)\n\nCredits\n\nI received design and color inspiration from Dribbble. Also, I used Hugo Giraudel’s items on a circle mixin. I really love that mixin!\n",

  content: "See the Pen Haml Calendar by Katy DeCorah (@katydecorah) on CodePen\n\nWhile I was looking through the Haml docs today, I found the ability to print out the date. My gears started spinning. Why not create a calendar?\n\nIt took a lot of research, but I made a functioning Haml Calendar. I say functioning, because it will display the correct date and tomorrow it will automatically display tomorrow’s date. You may also change the month, year, and day variables to display a specific date.\n\nI realize this is not a practicular calendar solution, but it was fun to figure out.\n\nI used these shots from Dribbble for layout and color inspiration.\n\nStarting out\n\nThe first step: print out today’s date. Once I got that, I created variables for month, year, and day that default to today’s date unless otherwise specified. I also created an array @days to hold the days of the week in the order I prefer.\n\nI looped through @days to create the headers for the calendar, but I decided to only display the first letter of each day. I used a list because I find that they are easier to style and they help keep my code organized.\n\n- @days = ['Sun','Mon','Tue','Wed','Thu','Fri','Sat']\n%ul.weekdays\n  - @days.each do |i|\n    %li.weekday\n      = i[0]\n\nNext I created a new list for the ordinal days of the calendar using a new loop:\n\n%ul.week\n  - (1...32).each do |i|\n    %li.day\n      = i\n\nI started by printing 31 days (with the start of the month at Sunday for now). I styled the list items so that only 7 can fit in each row. The list items naturally fell into calendar order.\n\nAt this point I had a calendar, but it wasn’t accurate. August begins on Thursday, not Sunday. I found that if I adjusted the starting value of my loop, I could get the first of the month to start on Thursday - (-3...32).each do |i|. That works, except now Sunday reads as -3 and so forth. I added a few constraints:\n\n%ul.week\n  - (-3...32).each do |i|\n    %li.day\n      - if i &gt; 0\n        = i\n\nThe items that are i &lt;= 0 still exist, but they don’t print a number. Instead they create blank space allowing August to begin on Thursday.\n\nThe calendar works, but it’s not dynamic.\n\nMaking it Dynamic\n\nI wrote a new variable called monthStart. Using the date function along with my variables for month and year, I could get the day each month starts on. I wrote another variable to find the position of the first of the month in my @days array. So in @days Thursday’s position is 4, but my loop needs to start at -3 for the month to start on that day. I wrote down every day, its position in the array, and what number the loop needs to start on in order for the month to start on that day. From these findings, I created a formula. I take the negative of the hash and add 1.\n\n- monthStart = Date.new(year, month, 1).strftime(\"%a\")\n- @days = ['Sun','Mon','Tue','Wed','Thu','Fri','Sat']\n- hashDays = Hash[@days.map.with_index.to_a]\n- monthStartNum = hashDays[monthStart]\n- adjustMonthStartNum = -monthStartNum + 1\n\nSo I updated my loop:\n\n%ul.week\n  - (adjustMonthStartNum...32).each do |i|\n    %li.day\n      - if i &gt; 0\n        = i\n\nTo make sure my loop worked, I changed my month variable to 9 to display September. It worked!\n\nHowever, September only has 30 days and I’m still printing out 31.\n\nI wrote another variable called monthEnd. This new variable was slightly easier than monthStart as I automatically receive an integer.\n\n- monthEnd = Integer(Date.new(year, month, -1).strftime(\"%d\"))\n\nI updated my loop once more (Here I add 1 to monthEnd to make sure it gets the last day and not up until the last day of the month):\n\n%ul.week\n  - (adjustMonthStartNum...monthEnd + 1).each do |i|\n    %li.day\n      - if i &gt; 0\n        = i\n\nYay! Dynamic!\n\nFinishing Up\n\nI added a few more constraints when printing out the days to highlight today and to mute the days before today. I think I can write this more efficiently, but I’m ok with my progress so far.\n\nIf you edit in CodePen, try writing in a custom date. I commented out the space for you to give it a try.\n\nI really enjoyed figuring this out. I’m new to Ruby, but I think I will do more experimenting!\n\np.s. I’m not sure about editing the timezone, so it might be a day ahead.\n",

The source file for each illusion can be found in the JS tab.\n\nOptical Illusion I\nSee the Pen Optical Illusion by Katy DeCorah (@katydecorah) on CodePen\n\nIn Haml, I spun out a list with 200 items. I put a width on the entire list of 100em and hid the overflow on the body. I wanted to make sure that each row remained in a row, but was wide enough to stretch across the browser. This came in handy when shifting the rows to create the illusion.\n\nI styled each list item the same, 5em square with a gray border-top. This makes 20 items in each row. Every even list item has a background of black.\n\nNext I had to shift every other row in order to create the optical illusion. Knowing I have 20 items in each row, I knew the range for each row (the first 1-20, the second 21-40 and so on). I wrote a @while loop to build an nth-child range and to increment to every other row.\n\nOptical Illusion II\n\nSee the Pen Optical Illusion II by Katy DeCorah (@katydecorah) on CodePen\n\nLike the previous pen, I used Haml to spin out over 300 list items. Each list item was styled the same. I added a width to the list to keep the rows from overlapping at smaller browser widths.\n\nI created a @while loop for each row. There are 24 items in each row, so after each row the varialbe $z is increased by 24.\n\nThe illusion creates three columns that are created by the narrowing of the list items. In order to define each pseudo column I adjusted the first three and last three items. I wrote a @while loop to target the first and last three items in each pseudo column. I defined variables for where each psuedo column begins and ends. The loop incrementally adjusts the width and margin-left. The loop runs a total of three times to account for the first and last three items in each pseudo column. The loop also swaps the border-color for the center pseudo column.\n\nThen I applied a clear on the first item in each row to be sure my rows remain as rows.\n\nOptical Illusion III\n\nSee the Pen Optical Illusion III by Katy DeCorah (@katydecorah) on CodePen\n\nAs before, I spun out 500 list items in Haml. I styled each item the same. All items have a ::before pseduo element that draws the circle. I absolutely positioned the circle to fit between each square.\n\nI gave the list margin: 0 -1em; and hid the overflow on the body. I wanted the illusion to completely fill the page.\n\nSuper simple to style and makes you want to barf after a few minues. A success!(?)\n",

My dream became a reality this weekend, with a few welcomed alterations. One tomato ripened, but instead of plucking it bedside I plucked it from the backyard that my boyfriend and I share outside of Albany. Wonderful, welcome alterations.\n\nI learned a lot from growing the tomatoes, but it really came down to proper hydration and sunlight. I received amazing sunlight in my Albany studio. I planted all the seeds not expecting them all to sprout, but they all grew! I had to give plants away and had to compost a few of the smaller ones. I ended up with 5 giant plants.\n\nOne mistake I made was that I waited too long to put them outside. I waited a few extra weeks just in case of cold weather, but I really shouldn’t have waited. Instead the plants started growing really tall (around 5 feet) to find more sunlight. By the time I put them outside they were weak and lanky. They ended up shedding most of their original leaves and grew stronger ones while outside.\n\nOnly one tomato has riped so far, I have about a dozen waiting to burst with color.

It took a some research, but I figured out how to use case statements. I have a feeling there is a better way to increment the numbers in each row, but I haven’t arrived at it yet.\n\nOnce I had everything styled, I tackled the position of the frame. The frame slides to indicate the entire month. The last two columns, highlighted in red, are the weekends. I knew I needed to find out today’s date (to understand the current month) and which day of the week the first day of the month starts. I found JavaScript to find the first day of the month for any given month or the current month.\n\nOnce I had the value for the first day of the month, I was set. August starts on a Thursday, or day of the week number 4 (remember the week starts on Monday). Now I know that, for any month that begins on a Thursday it will have the same starting position. I just needed to absolutely position the frame for each day of the week. I found the position by manually adjusting the numbers.

I did a lot of adjusting, experimenting, and asking the opinion of others before I settled on my recipe.\n\nThe jQuery was gnarly. I needed to know the width of the user’s browser at the start. From that value and the width of the lock, I created a specific ratio to be sure that the dial would spin proportionally. I calculated when the browser width would coincide with each combination number and added classes to the body to indicate when a success. Writing the jQuery took a lot of guessing, scribbling, and high school formulas, but I got it!\n",

Get it as flat as you can, without creating holes. Place flatten treat on top of the fruit roll-up. Try to trim excess so that the roll-up and treat match up.\n  Sprinkle candy along the center of the flatten treat, parallel to the longest edge of fruit roll-up/treat. Try to keep the candies in a line.\n  Grabbing the long edge of the fruit roll-up/treat, begin to roll towards the candy line. As you roll, try to carefully roll the candies in without breaking the fruit roll-up.\n  Once it’s rolled, cut the log into rounds.\n\n",
